# 📚 Study Materials for Data Science & Analysis

Welcome to the **Study** section of my portfolio!  
This folder contains notebooks and code snippets focused on key topics I've studied and found particularly useful in the field of **data science** and **data analysis**.

## 📌 Purpose
The goal of this folder is to:
- Reinforce concepts through hands-on practice
- Share learnings with others in the community
- Build a reference of useful techniques, patterns, and workflows

## 🧠 Topics Covered

Some of the areas explored include:

- 🐍 **SQL with Python**  
  Creating and manipulating databases, executing queries, and integrating SQL workflows via Python.

- 📊 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  Handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, date parsing, and data normalization.

- 🧾 **JSON Parsing and Nested Structures**  
  Loading, flattening, and working with real-world nested JSON data.

- 🐼 **Pandas Workflows**  
  Data transformation using `groupby`, `merge`, `explode`, and custom functions.

- 📅 **Time-Based Analysis**  
  Calculating delays, date differences, and time series insights.

- 🧮 **Statistical Summaries**  
  Aggregating and interpreting results from cleaned datasets.

- 💡 **Case Studies and Mini-Challenges**  
  Practical scenarios like rent payment tracking, invoice reconciliation, and more.

- ✂️ **Outlier Detection & Removal**  
Identifying and removing statistical outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to ensure clean and reliable data for analysis.

- 📈 **Data Visualization with Real-World Immigration Data**  
Creating compelling visualizations to explore immigration trends from Brazil and South America to Canada using line charts, bar plots, and interactive Plotly graphs. Emphasis on storytelling through data using theming, color palettes, and dynamic visual outputs.


## 📂 Structure

Each notebook is self-contained and titled according to the theme or task it explores.
