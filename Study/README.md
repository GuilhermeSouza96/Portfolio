# 📚 Study Materials for Data Science & Analysis

Welcome to the **Study** section of my portfolio!  
This folder contains notebooks and code snippets focused on key topics I've studied and found particularly useful in the field of **data science** and **data analysis**.

## 📌 Purpose
The goal of this folder is to:
- Reinforce concepts through hands-on practice
- Share learnings with others in the community
- Build a reference of useful techniques, patterns, and workflows

## 🧠 Topics Covered

Some of the areas explored include:

- 🐍 **SQL with Python**  
  Creating and manipulating databases, executing queries, and integrating SQL workflows via Python.

- 📊 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  Handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, date parsing, and data normalization.

- 🧾 **JSON Parsing and Nested Structures**  
  Loading, flattening, and working with real-world nested JSON data.

- 🐼 **Pandas Workflows**  
  Data transformation using `groupby`, `merge`, `explode`, and custom functions.

- 📅 **Time-Based Analysis**  
  Calculating delays, date differences, and time series insights.

- 🧮 **Statistical Summaries**  
  Aggregating and interpreting results from cleaned datasets.

- 💡 **Case Studies and Mini-Challenges**  
  Practical scenarios like rent payment tracking, invoice reconciliation, and more.

## 📂 Structure

Each notebook is self-contained and titled according to the theme or task it explores.
